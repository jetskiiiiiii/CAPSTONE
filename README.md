# RNA STRUCTURE PREDICTION

This project is for my capstone. My goal is to predict RNA structure from its sequence using machine learning.

### File structure

Inside CODE/PRACTICE are files used to practice various techniques which I studied.
They consist of mostly Jupyter Notebooks which have notes on how certain techniques work.

You can find the model which I'm trying to implement for structure prediction inside of MODELS/JET-RNA.
Currently, I have worked on RNA sequence representation (one hot encoding), building adjacency matrices from the dot bracket notation,
and analyzing stuructural elements within a given RNA structure.
